# ex01 My Awsome Phonebook
We have to simulate a phonebook with a terminal interactive UI. We can ADD or SEARCH for contacts and also EXIT clearing lists of contacts and ending program.
You have to implement 2 classes PhoneBook and Contact. <br>
**PhoneBook**
+ It has an array of contacts.
+ It can receive up to 8 contacts. If user try to add 9th contact, it will replace with 1st contact. <br>
**Contact**
+ Stands for phonebook contact
